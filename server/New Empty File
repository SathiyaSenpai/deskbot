act as a prompt engineer and expert and also a POML expert developer please write it for google ai studio.

"1. first it need to read and analyze all the files i uploaded.

2.it should think server.txt, ai-services.txt and app.txt as js files and platformio.txt as platformio.ini connect them with other files.

3. it should know what components are iam using for this project to give exact results for that components(1.3inch oled display, ultrasonic sensor, esp32, pir sensor, motion sensor, i2s amplifier, i2smic, rtc module, sg90 servo motor, 16bit led ring, jumper wires for touch sensor(head and side), ldr sensor, buzzer).

4. it should know what is the task of all the components and it can also add extra functions to those components work efficiently and with feature rich

5. it should analyze and undersand our web app and its integration with esp32

6. it also need to understand our algorithm, plans, eye movements, random eye blink and movement, animations, connections, etc...

7. it understand how the eye animations and size(rectangle with round edges like emo, no pupil) looks like and needs to think complex logics like how a eye should be animated while making expressions

8. there should be basic eye animations like(idle, happy, sad, angry or annoyed, sleepy, surprised)

9. all these animations should have a logic and emotions. it should understand how human read emotions and alter it that way for example(Eyes, Timing, Micro-movements, Sound cue)

10. all the animations should have a start animations middle and a ending animation and it should work smoothly (60fps) and properly without any glitches 

11. random eye movements, blinking animation and other animation and expressions should not conflict or interfere need make a protection and prevention for that

12. the animations should be linked with servo, led, buzzer, speaker via amplifier all these should return to normal after the animation or expression ends

13. animations should have effects for example(while sleepy it should show zzz) like these for other animations too think and add effects that best suits for each animations it hould look cute and lovely

14. servo also need to give more human like feel for example(Curious	Small left-right tilt, Happy	Quick nod, Sad	Slow downward tilt, Sleepy	Gradual droop, Confused	Tilt → pause → tilt opposite, Listening	Tilt toward sound)

15. buzzer (Boot chime (short, friendly)
Error beep (descending tone)
Surprise chirp
Sleep beep (soft fade))

16. for speaker via amplifier (Happy: soft “boop-boop”

Sad: low hum
Curious: rising tone
Angry: sharp short sound
Sleep: white noise / breathing loop)

17. for i2s mic(Loud sound → surprised eyes

Sustained sound → listening pose
Quiet room → sleepy mode
Your voice → eye focus + head tilt)

18. for 16bit led ring "🟢 Idle / Alive (MOST IMPORTANT)

Animation:
Soft breathing glow
Bright → dim → bright
2–4 second cycle
Very smooth

Color ideas:
Soft blue
Warm white

Pale cyan

💡 This tells the human: “I’m here.”

😊 Happy

Animation:

Slightly brighter breathing
Gentle pulse every 3–4 seconds

Color:
Yellow
Light green

Paired with: smiling eyes + tiny head nod
🥹 instant cuteness.

😮 Surprised

Animation:
Quick flash (150–250 ms)
Then fade back to idle

Color:
White or cyan

⚠️ Only once. No looping.

😢 Sad

Animation:
Slow dim pulse
Long pauses

Color:
Deep blue
Indigo

Feels heavy. That’s good.

😴 Sleep

Animation:
Very dim
Extremely slow breathing (5–7 sec cycle)

Color:
Dark blue
Purple

Bonus points if some LEDs are off, not all on.

😡 Angry / Alert

Animation:
Short sharp pulses
2–3 quick flashes

Color:
Red
Orange

Use rarely. Anger should feel uncomfortable.

Priority Order (Top wins):
Error / Danger
Surprise
Emotion (happy/sad/etc.)
Listening
Idle

So:
Surprise flash interrupts breathing
After flash → return to previous state
Never stack animations

One emotion at a time. Just like humans.

LED Ring + MIC

🎤 Sound-Reactive Ideas

Someone talks → ring gently brightens
Loud sound → instant white flash
Silence for long time → ring slowly dims
Your voice → slight pulse synced to volume
Fake listening > real listening.

Good Patterns
Breathing
Soft pulse
Gradient rotation (slow)
Partial ring glow (not full circle)

❌ Bad Patterns
Rainbow cycle
Fast spinning
Constant blinking
Full brightness always"

19. all the sensors should do their job and connected to web app

20. "Biggest Mistakes (don’t you dare do these)
❌ Blinking every 2 seconds
❌ Perfect timing (humans are messy)
❌ Moving everything at once
❌ Long sound loops
❌ Too many expressions

insted do this:
Idle breathing eyes + blink
Blink logic (random, human-like)
Head tilt on sound
Surprise reaction
Sleep mode"

21. it should never make memory clogging

22. need to plan about adding new animations like emo

23. never montion the word emo in  code if it aldready exist remove that and change to deskbot

24. it should work like human no robot like actions

25. the animations and effect should work efficiently on the oled display so never add emoji gifs or other files for effects, creates effects by coding like the eyes are created and the effects should also look cute

26. the effects should align and move with the eyes perfectly without overlapping with the eyes or making it wierd

27. the web app should work perfectly and all the features should be added. if any changes or adding feature needed in the web app. do it, after making changes in esp32 program make sure every features added to the web app and server also and everything finely connected without any errors

28. if anything missing it should be informed and planned to fix it without affecting anything or making issue

29. make sure it should work in esp32 perfectly because it is completely made to port esp32
